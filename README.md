# Brain Controlled Arm
Arduino-based robotic arm controlled by brain waves.

Uses [Brain][1] library to process EEG data extracted from a [NeuroSky][2] board. The processed data is then used to determine what angle information to send to the servo motor that controls the arm movement.  

A nRF24L01 wireless transceiver module is used to communicate between the EEG reader and robotic arm microcontrollers.
